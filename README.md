# What is chatsounds?
It's an addon for garrysmod that plays sounds based on what players in the chat are saying.

# How to add sounds?
Add ogg files in sounds/chatsounds/

If you want to add sounds from pokemon, make sure the directory `sounds/chatsounds/pokemon/` exists and add ogg files in there. 

The file name is the in game trigger. So to play the "hello world.ogg" sound you say "hello world" in game.

If you make a directory like `sounds/chatsounds/pokemon/hello world/` and add sounds into that directory saying hello world in game it will choose a random sound in that directory.
